TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week is flexiable week, doing some data. 
topic: bars-and-pubs-with-patron-capacity(this is the first line in table)
second line: Census year, Block ID, Base property ID, CLUE small area, Trading name, Business address, Number of patrons, Latitude, location

so, row_one = pub_data.iloc[1]
The index starts at 0, so row 1 is actually the data of row 2.
