TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
 The new point of using while, try, except. The “//” represents integer division, and the decimal part of the result will be discarded, retaining only the integer part, and “/” is floating-point division, which retains the decimal part. To make sure your code is correct, run a few test cases.

try and except : Used for exception handling to ensure that the program does not crash when encountering an error.
finally
while : Used to repeatedly execute a block of code while a condition is True.
for : Used to iterate over each element in a sequence.
if : Used to execute different blocks of code based on a condition.

print(result)  ：No spaces are required before（）
my_list.append("🌹"): .append means take 🌹 in my_list
