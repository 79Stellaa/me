TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

My question is: Why has the number of bars in Melbourne's CBD increased in the past 20 years?

In the early 2000s, the number of customers in the CBD was already more than that in the surrounding areas. From 2003 to the present, the number of customers in CBD bars has generally increased.

According to my investigation, in 2001: the Melbourne City Government launched a series of urban renewal plans to improve the infrastructure and public spaces in the CBD area. The project included the transformation of iconic areas such as Southbank and Federation Square, attracting more tourists and residents.

2006: Melbourne introduced the Myki card system, which improved the convenience of public transportation, making the CBD area more accessible and people more willing to choose entertainment in the CBD.

2010: The Melbourne City Government began to implement the "24-hour Melbourne" plan, extending the public transportation service hours on weekends and holidays, which greatly promoted the development of the night economy and made it more convenient and safe for people to travel at night.

2013: The government reformed the opening hours of bars and nightclubs, allowing them to open later, further promoting the development of nightlife.

2015: The Melbourne City Government increased its support for cultural activities and held a variety of art, music and food festivals, which were mainly concentrated in the CBD area and attracted a large number of tourists and local residents.

2016: Support policies for small businesses were introduced, simplifying the approval process for opening bars and restaurants, and encouraging more entrepreneurs to open new stores in the CBD.

2020: because of the convid 19, the number of parton had reduced. In response to the post-epidemic economic recovery, the Melbourne City Government strengthened safety measures and policy support for the night economy.

2022: The Melbourne City Government continues to promote the development of the night economy, with a special focus on improving the coverage and frequency of night public transportation.

Overall, the number of bars in the CBD area ranks first.
This is the result of the combined effect of many factors, including urban renewal, public transportation improvements, night economy policies, support for cultural activities, and business and safety measures. Specific policies and measures at each stage have played a key role in this growth, making the CBD a vibrant and attractive nightlife hub.

You can compare these two pictures and see that Melbourne has a very dense bar population.
